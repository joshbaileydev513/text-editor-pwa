## Description
For this Week 1 Challenge we were tasked with creating a Text Editor App that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.

## Installation
For installation instructions please visit my github repo https://github.com/joshbaileydev513/note-taker-app to clone and review the README provided.

## Usage
In order to use this app you will first need to navigate to the `Develop` folder and open up a terminal. When the terminal is open, run the command `npm i` to install your dependencies. When those are finished installing, type `npm run build` into your GitBash terminal which will cd to the client folder and run npm build. Once that is finished, you will type the command `npm run start` which will start the server and open up our localhost on port 3000. Click on that link `http://localhost:3000` to view it within the browser. Once you are there, you can begin typing in the text editor which mimics something similar to a mix between a notepad app and command terminal. You will notice the install button in the upper left hand corner which can be used to install the PWA to use offline as well!
